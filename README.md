# weather-app  

Simple app displaying the weather in certain locations using API.  

Learning async and fetching data from APIs.  
  
Note: Please ignore the API Key being at risk (it's free), this current project was just to practice
API fetching, promises, and async functions.  
( The Loader style is dumb, I know. I just wanted to apply the function and logic first. It will be better, I promise ).
